Problem 1

Loading the dataset into R and extracting the paths of the files to name then into lists

``` r
plyr::ldply(.data = "./data/hw5_data.zip", .fun = unzip)
```

``` r
path_files = list.files("./data", pattern = ".csv", full.names = TRUE)

names_files = basename(path_files)
```

Using a function to read the data

``` r
fn_read = function(data, tag_name){
  list(read_csv(file = data) %>% mutate(identity = tag_name))
}
```

In order to read all the csv files, we will iterate using the `map`function

``` r
read_all = purrr::map2(path_files, names_files, fn_read)
```

``` r
